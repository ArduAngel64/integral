I'm not going to explain what is a Integral

Example of what my program does:

f(x) = sin(x)     
     b     
A ≅ ∫ f(x)dx     
     a     
 
A is the Integral approximation.

Move around the plot with w, a, s and d keys. a and d change limits
Horizontal zoom with q and e keys. This change limits
Vertical zoom with z and c keys
Change resolution with x and v keys. Note: this may cause error in integral aproximtion

With n = 10000, f(x) = sin(x) and limits 0-π this program aproximates its ∫f(x)dx with an error of 9.5*10⁻⁵

Hope this is useful to anyone
